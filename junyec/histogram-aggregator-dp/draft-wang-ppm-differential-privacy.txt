1.  Introduction

   Multi-party computation systems like the Distributed Aggregration
   Protocol [DAP] enable secure aggregation of measurements generated by
   individuals without handling the measurements in the clear.  This is
   made possible by using a Verifiable Distributed Aggregation Function
   [VDAF], the core cryptographic component of DAP.  Execution of A VDAF
   involves: a large set of "Clients" who produce cryptographically
   protected measurements, called "reports"; a small number of
   "Aggregators" who consume reports and produce the cryptographically
   protected aggregate; and a "Collector" who consumes the aggregate
   result.  Distributing the computation of the aggregate in this manner
   ensures that, as long as one Aggregator is honest, no attacker can
   learn an honest Client's measurement.

   Depending on the application, protecting the measurements may not be
   sufficient for privacy, since the aggregate itself can reveal
   privacy-sensitive information.  As an illustrative example, consider
   using DAP/VDAF to summarize the distribution of the heights of
   respondents to a survey.  If one of the respondents is especially
   short or tall, then their contribution is likely to skew the summary
   statistic in a way that reveals their height.  Ideally, no individual
   measurement would have such a signficant impact on the aggregate
   result, but in general such leakage is inevitable.

   This intuition can be formalized by the notion differential privacy
   [DMNS06].  Differentially privacy is a property of an algorithm or
   protocol that computes some function of a set of measurements.  We
   say the algorithm or protocol is "differentially private", or "DP",
   if the probability of observing a particular output does not change
   signficantly as a result of removing one of the measurements (or
   substituting it with another).

   VDAFs are not DP on their own, but they can be composed with a
   variety of mechanisms that endow them with this property.  All such
   mechanisms work by introducing "noise" into the computation that is
   carefully calibrated for a number of application-specific parameters,
   including the structure and number of measurements, the desired
   aggregation function, and the degree of "utility" required.
   Intuitively, a high degree of privacy can be achieved by adding a lot
   of noise; but adding too much noise can reduce the usefulness of the
   aggregate result.

   Noise can be introduced at various steps at the computation, and by
   various parties.  Depending on the mechanism: the Clients might add
   noise to their own measurements; and the Aggregators might add noise
   to their aggregate shares (the values they produce for the
   Collector).

   In this document, we shall refer to the composition of DP mechanisms
   into a scheme that provides (some notion of) DP as a "DP policy".
   For some policies, noise is added only by the Clients or only by the
   Aggregators, but for others, both Clients and Aggregators may
   participate in generating the noise.

   The primary goal of this document is to specify how DP policies are
   implemented in DAP.  It does so in the following stages:

   1.  Section 3 describes the notion(s) of DP that are compatible with
       DAP and provides a systematization of applicable DP policies from
       the literature.  Security is defined in a few different "trust
       models" in which we assume that some fraction of the parties
       execute the protocol honestly.  Of course in reality, whether
       such assumptions hold is usually outside of our control.  Thus
       our goal is to design DP policies that still provide some degree
       of protection in more pessimistic trust models.

   2.  Section 4 specifies various mechanisms required for building DP
       systems, including algorithms for sampling from discrete Laplace
       and Gaussian distributions.

   3.  Section 5 defines DP policies and specifies concrete policies for
       endowing VDAFs in [VDAF] with DP.  [TODO: And other drafts, once
       they appear.]  [CP: This API may not be compatible with all DP
       polices we might want to implement.]

   4.  Section 5.2 specifies the integration of DP policies from the
       previous section into DAP.  In particular, it describes changes
       to the Client, Aggregator, and Collector behavior required to
       implement the policy.  [CP: This integration might not be
       compatible with all DP policies we might want to implement.]

   The following considerations are out-of-scope for this document:

   1.  DP policies have a few parameters that need to be tuned in order
       to meet the privacy/utility tradeoff required by the application.
       This document provides no guidance for this process.

   2.  This document describes a particular class of narrowly-scoped DP
       policies.  Other, more sophisticated policies are possible.
       [TODO: Add citations.]

   3.  The mechanisms described in Section 4 are intended for use beyond
       DAP/VDAF.  However, this document does not describe general-
       purpose DP policies; those described in Section 5 are tailored to
       specific VDAFs or classes of VDAFs.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document uses the same conventions for error handling as [DAP].

   Let exp(EPSILON) denote raising the numeric constant e to the power
   of EPSILON.

   Under Central Limit Theorem (CLT), the sum of a large number of
   independently and identically distributed random variables
   approximates a normal distribution, or Gaussian distribution.

3.  Security Goals and Trust Model

3.1.  Differential Privacy

   DP formalizes a property of any randomized algorithm that takes in a
   sequence of measurements, aggregates them, and outputs an aggregate
   result.  Intuitively, this property guarantees that no single
   measurement signficantly impacts the value of the aggregate result.
   This intuition is formalized by [DMNS06] as follows.

      CP: The following is might be too jargony for an informative RFC,
      but for now I think we're all just trying to agree on the
      definition.  Once we have consensus among ourselves, we can punt
      this to the appendix and leave a less formal description here.

   We say that two batches of measurements D1 and D2 are "neighboring"
   if they are the same length and contain all the same measurements
   except one (i.e., the symmetric difference between the multisets
   contains two elements).

   There are primarily two models in the literature for defining two
   "neighboring batches": deletion (or removal) of one measurement, and
   replacement (or substitution) of one measurement with another [KM11].
   Only the latter ("replacement-DP") applies to DAP, as the protocol
   leaks the number of measurements in each batch collected, so for any
   randomized algorithm that computes an aggregate result over a
   sequence of Client measurements, we want to be able to define its DP
   property in terms of replacement-DP.

   Let p(S, D, r) denote the probability that randomized algorithm S, on
   input of measurements D, outputs aggregate result r.

   A randomized algorithm S is called "EPSILON-DP" if for all
   neighboring D1 and D2 and all possible aggregate results r, the
   following inequality holds:

   p(S, D1, r) <= exp(EPSILON) * p(S, D2, r)

   In other words, the probability that neighboring inputs produce a
   given aggregate result differs by at most a constant factor,
   exp(EPSILON).

   One can think of EPSILON as a measure of how much information about
   the measurements is leaked by the aggregate result: the smaller the
   EPSILON, the less information is leaked by S.  For many DP
   mechanisms, it is possible to make EPSILON so close to 0 that the
   difference between p(S, D1, r) and p(S, D2, r) is negligible.
   However, this requires adding more noise, which has an adverse impact
   on utility.  Most applications will accept a non-negligible bound in
   order to achieve reasonable utility.  See Appendix B for details.

   This notion of EPSILON-DP is sometimes referred to as "pure-DP".  The
   following is a relaxation of pure-DP, called "approximate-DP", from
   [DR14].  A randomized algorithm S is called "(EPSILON, DELTA)-DP" if
   for all neighboring D1 and D2 and all possible aggregate results r,
   the following inequality holds:

   p(S, D1, r) <= exp(EPSILON) * p(S, D2, r) + DELTA

   Compared to pure-DP, approximate-DP loses an additive factor of DELTA
   in the bound.  This is to account for certain DP mechanisms that have
   some desirable properties, but are not pure-DP.  See Section 4 for
   details.

   Other variants of DP are possible; see the literature review in
   Appendix B for details.

3.2.  Sensitivity

   Differential privacy noise sometimes needs to be calibered based on
   the SENSITIVITY of an aggregation function used to compute the
   aggregate result over Client measurements.  Sensitivity characterizes
   how much a change in a Client measurement can affect the aggregate
   result.  In this document, we focus on the L1 and L2 sensitivity.  We
   define them as a function over two neighboring Client measurements:

   *  L1 sensitivity: the sum of the absolute values of differences at
      all coordinates of the neighboring Client measurements.

   *  L2 sensitivity: the sum of the squares of the differences at all
      coordinates of the neighboring Client measurements.

3.3.  Trust Models

   When considering whether a given DP policy is sufficient for DAP, it
   is not enough to consider the mechanisms used in isolation.  It is
   also necessary to consider the process by which the policy is
   executed.  In particular, our threat model for DAP considers an
   attacker that participates in the upload, aggregation, and collection
   protocols and may use its resources to attack the underlying
   cryptographic primitives (VDAF [VDAF], HPKE [RFC9180], and TLS
   [RFC8446]).

   To account for such attackers, our goal for DAP is "computational-DP"
   as described by [MPRV09] (Definition 4, "SIM-CDP").  This formalizes
   the amount of information a computationally bounded attacker can
   glean about the measurements generated by honest Clients over the
   course of its attack on the protocol.  We consider an attacker that
   controls the network and statically corrupts a subset of the parties.

   We say the protocol is pure-DP (resp. approximate-DP) if the view of
   any computationally bounded attacker can be efficiently simulated by
   a simulator that itself is pure-DP (or approximate-DP) as defined
   above.  (The simulator takes the measurements as input and outputs a
   value that is computationally indistinguishable from the transcript
   of the protocol's execution in the presence of the attacker.)

   Whether this property holds for a given DP policy depends on which
   parties can be trusted to execute the protocol correctly (i.e., which
   parties are not corrupted by the attacker).  We consider three,
   increasingly pessimistic trust models.

3.3.1.  OAMC: One-Aggregator-Most-Clients

   Assume that most Clients and one Aggregator are honest and that the
   other Aggregator and the Collector are controlled by the attacker.
   When all Clients are honest, this corresponds to the same trust model
   as the base DAP protocol.  Te degree of privacy provided (i.e., the
   value of EPSILON for pure-DP) should degrade gracefully as the number
   of honest Clients decreases.

3.3.2.  OAOC: One-Aggregator-One-Client

   Assume that at least one Aggregator is honest.  The other Aggregator,
   the Collector, and all but one Clients are controlled by the
   attacker.  The goal is to provide protection for the honest Client's
   measurement.

      TODO(issue#15) For the simple Aggregator-noise mechanism, if the
      malicious Aggregator cheats by not adding noise, then the
      aggregate result is not DP from the point of view of the honest
      Aggregator, unless the honest Aggregagtor "forgets" the randomness
      it used.  Describe this "attack" in "Security Considerations" and
      say why it's irrelevant.

3.4.  OC: One-Client

   Assume that all parties, including all but one Client, both
   Aggregators, and the Collector are controlled by the attacker.  The
   best a policy can hope for is that the honest Client's measurement
   has "local-DP".  This property is defined the same way as pure- or
   approximate-DP, except that the bound that we aim to achieve is
   looser than what we can get in a more optimisitc trust model.

3.5.  Hedging

   If a trust model's assumptions turn out to be false in practice, then
   it is desirable for a DP policy to maintain some degree of privacy in
   a more pessimistic trust model.  For example, a deployment of DAP
   might provide some mechanism to ensure that all reports that are
   consumed were generated by trusted Clients (e.g., a Trusted Execution
   Environment (TEE) at each Client).  This gives us confidence that our
   assumptions in the OAMC trust model hold.  But if this mechanism is
   broken (e.g., a flaw is found in the TEE), then it is desirable if
   the policy remains DP in the OAOC or OC model, perhaps with a weaker
   bound.

4.  DP Mechanisms

   This section describes various mechanisms required for implementing
   DP policies.  The algorithms are designed to securely expand a short,
   uniform random seed into a sample from a given distribution.

   For each mechanism, we expect the noise parameters are computed based
   on the DP guarantee that it is supposed to provide.

   We also expect DP mechanisms to contain the following
   functionalities:

   *  Add noise to a piece of input data (i.e. a measurement or an
      aggregate share).  Some DP mechanisms apply noise based on the
      input data, e.g. randomized response mechanism Section 4.3 flips
      the bit at each dimension, which means the noised output depends
      on the input.

   *  Sample noise with the DP mechanism.

   *  Debias the noised data.  Note that not all noise will need this
      functionality.  Some DP mechanisms will need this functionality,
      for example, randomized response mechanisms have a debiasing step
      that removes bias.

   Therefore, we define three methods for an interface DpMechanism:

  class DpMechanism:
      # The data type applicable to this `DpMechanism`. The type is the
      # same for the noised data and the un-noised data.
      DataType = None
      # Debiased data type after removing bias added by the noise. For
      # most of the mechanisms, `DebiasedDataType == DataType`.
      DebiasedDataType = None

      def add_noise(self, data: DataType) -> DataType:
          """Add noise to a piece of input data. """
          raise NotImplementedError()

      def sample_noise(self, dimension: int) -> DataType:
          """
          Sample noise with the initialized `DpMechanism`. `dimension`
          is used to determine the length of the output if `DataType` is
          a list.
          """
          raise NotImplementedError()

      def debias(self,
                 data: DataType,
                 meas_count: int) -> DebiasedDataType:
          """
          Debias the data due to the added noise, based on the number of
          measurements `meas_count`. This doesn't apply to all DP
          mechanisms. Some Client-DP mechanisms need this functionality.
          """
          return data

4.1.  Discrete Laplace

      TODO: Specify a Laplace sampler from Algorithm 2 of [CKS20] (#10).

4.2.  Discrete Gaussian

      TODO: Specify a Gaussian sampler from Algorithm 3 of [CKS20]
      (#10).

4.3.  Binary Randomized Response

   This section describes the binary randomized response mechanism,
   specified in Appendix C.1 of [MJTB_22].  It is initialized with a
   parameter EPSILON_0, and takes in a single bit x.  The bit is flipped
   to 1 - x with probability 1 / (exp(EPSILON_0) + 1).  For example, if
   EPSILON_0 is configured to be 3, and the input to binary randomized
   response is a 0, the bit will be flipped to be 1 with probability 1 /
   (exp(3) + 1), otherwise, it will stay as a 0.

   Under OC trust model, by applying binary randomized response with
   EPSILON_0 parameter to its measurement, the Client gets EPSILON_0-DP
   in deletion-DP model (Definition II.4 of [EFMR_20], and Definition
   C.1 of [MJTB_22]).  A formal definition of deletion-DP is elaborated
   in Section 4.3.1.

   We generalize binary randomized response mechanism by applying it
   independently at all coordinates of a Client's bit vector.  Under
   OAMC trust model, it is proven in Appendix C.1.3 of [MJTB_22] that we
   get good (EPSILON, DELTA)-DP in the replacement-DP model, by
   aggregating a batch of noisy Client measurements, each of which is a
   bit vector with exactly one bit set, and is noised with binary
   randomized response at all coordinates.  The final aggregate result
   needs to be "debiased" due to the noise added by the Clients, and is
   expressed as a vector of floats, because of floating point
   arithmetic.

   Since the noise generated by each Client at each coordinate is
   independent, and as the number of Clients n grows, the noise
   distribution at each coordinate approximates a Gaussian distribution,
   with standard deviation sqrt(n * exp(EPSILON_0) / (exp(EPSILON_0) -
   1)^2), as proved by Theorem C.2 of [MJTB_22].

4.3.1.  EPSILON_0-DP in Deletion-DP

      JC: We only add a definition of deletion-DP here since this is
      likely the only mechanism that provides deletion-DP in the OC
      trust model.  Putting it in overview might confuse readers early
      on, because we said only replacement-DP applies to DAP.

   Let P1(S, D, E) denote the probability that a randomized algorithm S,
   on an input measurement D, outputs a noisy measurement E.  Let P2(R,
   E) denote the probability that a reference noisy output R is equal to
   E.  A randomized algorithm S is said to be EPSILON_0-DP in the
   deletion-DP model, if there exists a reference distribution R, such
   that for all possible Client measurements D, and all possible noisy
   outputs E, we have:

   -EPSILON_0 <= ln(P1(S, D, E) / P2(R, E)) <= EPSILON_0

   Intuitively, if we think of the reference distribution R as an
   average, noisy Client measurement, deletion-DP makes it hard to
   distinguish the Client measurement D from the measurement from an
   average Client.

4.3.2.  Reference Implementation

   A reference implementation of binary randomized response can be found
   below.

      TODO: We need to align with Xof specified in the VDAF draft.
      Currently we get away with just using random.random() in python to
      make the randomized response sampler functional.  TODO: We could
      make the sampler more efficient if we use binomial.

   import random

   class BinaryRandomizedResponse(DpMechanism):
       DataType = list[int]
       # Debiasing produces an array of floats.
       DebiasedDataType = list[float]

       def __init__(self, eps0: float):
           self.eps0 = eps0
           self.p = 1.0 / (math.exp(eps0) + 1.0)

       def add_noise(self, data: DataType) -> DataType:
           # Apply binary randomized response at each coordinate, based
           # on Appendix C.1.1 of {{MJTB+22}}.
           return list(map(
               lambda x: 1 - x if self.coin_flip() else x,
               data
           ))

       def sample_noise(self, dimension: int) -> DataType:
           # Sample binary randomized response at each coordinate on an
           # all zero vector.
           return [int(self.coin_flip()) for coord in range(dimension)]

       def debias(self,
                  data: DataType,
                  meas_count: int) -> DebiasedDataType:
           # Debias the data based on Appendix C.1.2 of {{MJTB+22}}.
           exp_eps = math.exp(self.eps0)
           return list(map(
               lambda x: (x * (exp_eps + 1) / (exp_eps - 1) -
                          meas_count / (exp_eps - 1)),
               data
           ))

       def coin_flip(self):
           return random.random() < self.p

5.  DP Policies for VDAFs

   The section defines a generic interface for DP policies for VDAFs.

   We will define an interface DpPolicy that composes the following:

   *  An optional Client-DP mechanism that adds noise to Clients'
      measurements.

   *  An optional Aggregator-DP mechanism that adds noise to an
      Aggregator's aggregate share, based on the number of measurements,
      and the minimum batch size.

   *  An optional debiasing step that removes the bias in DP mechanisms
      (i.e.  DpMechanism.debias).

   The composition of Client- and Aggregator-DP mechanisms defines the
   DP policy for a VDAF, and enforces the DP guarantee.

  class DpPolicy:
      # Client measurement type.
      Measurement = None
      # Aggregate share type, owned by an Aggregator.

5.2.  Executing DP Policies in DAP

      TODO: Specify integration of a DpPolicy into DAP.

6.  Use Cases

6.1.  Histograms

   Many applications require aggregating histograms in which each Client
   submits a bit vector with exactly one bit set, also known as, "one-
   hot vector".  We describe two policies that achieve (EPSILON, DELTA)-
   DP on this use case: one which uses only a Client-DP mechanism and
   targets the OAMC trust model, and another which uses only an
   Aggregator-DP mechanism and targets the more stringent OAOC trust
   model.  We discover that both policies in different settings of
   EPSILON and DELTA provide comparable utility, except that the policy
   in the OAOC trust model requires all Aggregators to independently add
   noise, so we lose some utility when more than one Aggregator is
   honest.

6.1.1.  Prio3MultiHotHistogram with Client-DP

      JC: For robustness, currently we will use a private VDAF
      Prio3MultiHotHistogram discussed in https://github.com/cfrg/draft-
      irtf-cfrg-vdaf/issues/287, that supports checking for bounded
      number of 1s after the one-hot vector goes through randomized
      response Client-DP.  We will need to update VDAF draft to specify
      the validity circuit.

   Client-DP allows Clients to protect their privacy by adding noise to
   their measurements directly, as described in Appendix B.1.  Analyses
   ([FMT20] and [FMT22]) have shown that, in the OAMC trust model, we
   get good (EPSILON, DELTA)-DP, by aggregating noisy Clients'
   measurements with Client-DP.  In this policy, we will describe how to
   achieve (EPSILON, DELTA)-DP, with binary randomized response Client-
   DP mechanism, along with Prio3MultiHotHistogram VDAF for robustness
   considerations.

6.1.1.1.  Client-DP Mechanism

   The Client-DP we will use here is the binary randomized response
   mechanism described in Section 4.3, which is initialized with a
   EPSILON_0 parameter.  We get (EPSILON, DELTA)-DP in the aggregate
   result, as long as there are at least batch_size number of honest
   Clients, each of which adds the randomized response Client-DP to its
   measurement, and contributes the noisy measurement to the batch.  The
   (EPSILON, DELTA)-DP degrades gracefully as the number of honest
   Clients decreases, i.e., we can still achieve (EPSILON', DELTA)-DP,
   where EPSILON' is larger than EPSILON.

      TODO(junyechen1996): Justify why RR with EPSILON_0 + batch_size
      can achieve (EPSILON, DELTA)-DP in the aggregate result.

6.1.1.2.  VDAF Robustness

   Because applying binary randomized response at all coordinates of an
   one-hot Client measurement can cause the noisy measurement to have
   multiple bits set, we we need to check the noisy measurement has at
   most m number of 1s, per Section 4.5 of [TWMJ_23], to ensure
   robustness against malicious Clients, who attempt to bias the final
   histogram by setting many coordinates to be 1.

   Assume the length of the Client measurement is d, and there is
   exactly one bit set.  For the d - 1 coordinates with 0s, the
   probability p_0 of changing a coordinate from 0 to 1 is 1 /
   (exp(EPSILON_0) + 1) per Section 4.3, so we can model the number of
   1s in the noisy measurement as a binomial random variable C with
   number of trials d - 1, and probability p_0, plus the one bit that is
   already set.  Our goal is to ensure the probability p of 1 + C
   exceeding m is small enough, i.e., the false positive rate of a noisy
   measurement from an honest Client having more than m bits is at most
   p.  This is equivalent to finding m and p, such that the cumulative
   distribution function (CDF) satisfies Pr(C <= m - 1) >= 1 - p.

   Once we find m, we will use it to instantiate Prio3MultiHotHistogram
   to perform verification and aggregation.  The final aggregate result
   is debiased based on the number of measurements according to
   Section 4.3, in order to reduce the bias introduced during Client-DP.

   class MultiHotHistogramWithClientDp(DpPolicy):
       Field = MultiHotHistogram.Field
       Measurement = MultiHotHistogram.Measurement
       AggShare = list[Field]
       AggResult = MultiHotHistogram.AggResult
       DebiasedAggResult = BinaryRandomizedResponse.DebiasedDataType

       def __init__(self, eps0: float):
           # TODO(junyechen1996): Justify how eps0 + batch_size can
           # achieve `(EPSILON, DELTA)`-DP.
           self.rr = BinaryRandomizedResponse(eps0)

       def add_noise_to_measurement(self,
                                    meas: Measurement,
                                    ) -> Measurement:
           return self.rr.add_noise(meas)

       def debias_agg_result(self,
                             agg_result: AggResult,
                             meas_count: int,
                             ) -> DebiasedAggResult:
           return self.rr.debias(agg_result, meas_count)

6.1.1.3.  Utility

   As discussed in Section 4.3, as the number of Clients n increases,
   the noise at each coordinate of the debiased aggregate result
   approximates a Gaussian distribution with standard deviation sqrt(n *
   exp(EPSILON_0) / (exp(EPSILON_0) - 1)^2).  We will look at the
   standard deviation generated by binary randomized response from n
   Clients, in order to achieve various combinations of (EPSILON,
   DELTA)-DP.

      +=========+=======+====================+=====================+
      | EPSILON | DELTA | Standard deviation | Internal Parameters |
      +=========+=======+====================+=====================+
      | 0.317   | 1e-9  | 26.1336            | n = 100000,         |
      |         |       |                    | EPSILON_0 = 5.0     |

      | 0.906   | 1e-9  | 12.2799            | n = 100000,         |
      |         |       |                    | EPSILON_0 = 6.5     |
      +---------+-------+--------------------+---------------------+
      | 1.528   | 1e-9  | 5.7939             | n = 100000,         |
      |         |       |                    | EPSILON_0 = 8.0     |

6.1.2.  Prio3Histogram with Aggregator-DP

   Aggregator-DP requires Aggregators to add noise to their aggregate
   shares before outputting them.  In the OAOC trust model, we can
   achieve good EPSILON-DP, or (EPSILON, DELTA)-DP, as long as at least
   one of the Aggregators is honest.  The amount of noise needed by
   Aggregator-DP typically depends on the target DP parameters EPSILON
   and DELTA, and also the SENSITIVITY Section 3.2 of the aggregation
   function.

   In this section, we describe how to achieve (EPSILON, DELTA)-DP for
   Prio3Histogram Section 7.4.4 of [VDAF] by asking each Aggregator to
   independently add discrete Gaussian noise to its aggregate share.

6.1.2.1.  Discrete Gaussian Mechanism for Aggregator-DP

   We use the discrete Gaussian mechanism described in Section 4.2,
   which has a mean of 0, and is initialized with a SIGMA parameter that
   stands for the standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution.  In
   order to achieve (EPSILON, DELTA)-DP in the OAOC trust model, all
   Aggregators need to independently add discrete Gaussian noise to all
   coordinates of their aggregate shares.

   Theorem 8 in [BW18] shows how to compute SIGMA parameter for
   continuous Gaussian, based on the given (EPSILON, DELTA)-DP
   parameters and L2-sensitivity, and Theorem 7 in [CKS20] shows a
   similar result for discrete Gaussian.  In a histogram use case where
   each Client submits an one-hot vector, the L2-sensitivity is sqrt(2),
   because transforming an one-hot vector into another will affect two
   coordinates, e.g., transforming an one-hot vector [1, 0] to [0, 1]
   changes L2-sensitivity by sqrt((1 - 0)^2 + (0 - 1)^2) = sqrt(2).
   Algorithm 1 in [BW18] elaborates on how to compute SIGMA, and we will
   refer to the calculation in the open sourced code [AGM].

      JC: We will need to provide an explanation of the parameter
      calculation in the draft itself, instead of merely referring to
      the code.

      JC: [CKS20] mentions in Theorem 7 about the approximate-DP
      guarantee achieved by discrete [CKS20] and continuous Gaussian
      [BW18] that: The discrete and continuous Gaussian attain almost
      identical guarantees for large SIGMA, but the discretization
      creates a small difference that becomes apparent for small SIGMA.
      Therefore, if we use Algorithm 1 from [BW18], we will need to be
      careful when SIGMA is small, i.e., the desired (EPSILON, DELTA)-DP
      is weak.

      JC: It's also worth exploring the utility of discrete Gaussian
      proven by Definition 3 in [CKS20], which defines the concentrated-
      DP achieved by discrete Gaussian.  Concentrated-DP is then
      converted to approximate-DP, which is our target here.  As a first
      draft, we won't overwhelm readers with other types of DP.

  class HistogramWithAggregatorDp(DpPolicy):
      Field = Histogram.Field
      # A measurement is an unsigned integer, indicating an index less
      # than `Histogram.length`.
      Measurement = Histogram.Measurement
      AggShare = list[Field]
      AggResult = Histogram.AggResult
      # The final aggregate result should be a vector of signed
      # integers, because discrete Gaussian could produce negative
      # noise that may have a larger absolute value than the count
      # before noise.

          # Transforming an one-hot vector into another will affect two
          # coordinates, e.g. from [1, 0, 0] to [0, 1, 0], so the change

          for (agg_share_i, noise_vec_i) in zip(agg_share, noise_vec):
              if noise_vec_i < 0:
                  noise_vec_i = Field.MODULUS + noise_vec_i
              result.append(agg_share_i + self.Field(noise_vec_i))
          return result

      def debias_agg_result(self,

          # negative values or 0 properly. For now, directly return it,
          # since we haven't fully implemented discrete Gaussian
          # mechanism (#10).
          return agg_result

6.1.2.2.  Utility

   We will demonstrate the utility of this policy in the table below in
   terms of the standard deviation SIGMA in discrete Gaussian needed to
   achieve various combinations of (EPSILON, DELTA)-DP, based on the
   open-sourced code in [AGM].

   It's worth noting that if more than one Aggregator is honest, we will
   lose some utility because each Aggregator is independently adding
   noise.  The standard deviation in the aggregate result thus becomes
   SIGMA * sqrt(c), where c is the number of honest Aggregators.  In the
   table below, the numbers in "Standard deviation" column assume c = 2.
   The numbers in "Standard deviation (OAOC)" column assume only one
   Aggregator is honest.

   +=========+=======+====================+===========================+
   | EPSILON | DELTA | Standard deviation | Standard deviation (OAOC) |
   +=========+=======+====================+===========================+

Appendix B.  Overview of Differential Privacy

   Differential privacy is a set of techniques used to protect the
   privacy of individuals when analyzing user's data.  It provides a
   mathematical framework that ensures the analysis of a dataset does
   not reveal identifiable information about any specific individuals.
   The advantage of differential privacy is that it provides a strong,
   quantifiable and composable privacy guarantee.  The main idea of
   differential privacy is to add carefully calibrated noise to the
   results, which makes it difficult to determine with high certainty
   whether a specific individual's data was included in the results or
   not.

B.1.  Differential privacy levels

   Ther are two levels of privacy protection: local differential privacy
   (local DP) and aggregator differential privacy (aggregator DP).

      OPEN ISSUE: or call it secure aggregator dp, or central dp.

   In the local-DP settings, Clients apply noise to their own
   measurements.  In this way, Clients have some control to protect the
   privacy of their own data.  Any measurement uploaded by a Client will
   be have local dp, Client's privacy is protected even if none of the
   Aggregators is honest (although this protection may be weak).
   Furthermore, one can analyze the aggregator DP guarantee with privacy
   amplification by aggregation, assuming each Client has added the
   required amount of local DP noise, and there are at least minimum
   batch size number of Clients in the aggregation.

   In Aggregator DP settings, an Aggregator applies noise on the
   aggregation.  Aggregator DP relies on the server being secure and
   trustworthy.  Aggregators built using DAP protocol is ideal for this
   setting because DAP ensures no server can access any individual data,
   but only the aggregation.

   If there are no local DP added from client, noise added to the
   aggregation provides the privacy guarantee of the aggregation.

   One can use the Aggregator DP noise together with local DP noise to
   achieve privacy guarantee.  If the DP guarantee is achieved with a
   minimum batch size number of Clients adding local DP noise, and
   minimum batch size is not reached when a data collection task
   expires, each Aggregator can add the remaining noise by generating
   the same local DP noise, on the missing number of Clients being the
   gap between actual number of Clients and minimum batch size.

      TODO: Chris P to fill: user or report, given time

B.3.  Privacy budget and accounting

   There are various types of DP guarantees and budgets that can be
   enforced.  Many applications need to query the Client data multiple
   times, for example:

   *  Federated machine learning applications require multiple
      aggregates to be computed over the same underlying data, but with
      different machine learning model parameters.

   *  [MJTB_22] describes an interactive approach of building histograms
      over multiple iterations, and Section 4.3 describes a way to track
      Client-side budget when the Client data is queried multiple times.

      TODO: have citations for machine learning

   It’s hard for Aggregator(s) to keep track of the privacy budget over
   time, because different Clients can participate in different data
   collection tasks, and only Clients know when their data is queried.
   Therefore, Clients must enforce the privacy budget.

   There could be multiple ways to compose DP guarantees, based on
   different DP composition theorems.  In the various example DP
   guarantees below, we describe the following:

   *  A formal definition of the DP guarantee.

   *  Composition theorems that apply to the DP guarantee.

B.4.  Pure EPSILON-DP, or (EPSILON, DELTA)-approximate DP

   Pure EPSILON-DP was first proposed in [DMNS06], and a formal
   definition of (EPSILON, DELTA)-DP can be found in Definition 2.4 of
   [DR14].

   The EPSILON parameter quantifies the "privacy loss" of observing the
   outcomes of querying two databases differing by one element.  The
   smaller EPSILON is, the stronger the privacy guarantee is, that is,
   the outcomes of querying two adjacent databases are more or less the
   same.  The DELTA parameter provides a small probability of the
   privacy loss exceeding EPSILON.

   One can compose multiple (EPSILON, DELTA)-approximate DP guarantees,
   per Theorem 3.4 of [KOV15].  One can also compose the guarantees in
   other types of guarantee first, such as Rényi DP Appendix B.4.1, and
   then convert the composed guarantee to approximate DP guarantee.

B.4.1.  (ALPHA, TAU)-Rényi DP

   A formal definition of Rényi DP can be found in Definitions 3 and 4
   of [Mir17].

   The intuition behind Rényi-DP is to use TAU parameter to measure the
   divergence of probability distributions of querying two adjacent
   databases, given Rényi order parameter ALPHA.  The smaller the TAU
   parameter, the harder it is to distinguish the outputs from querying
   two adjacent databases, and thus the stronger the privacy guarantee
   is.

   One can compose multiple Rényi DP guarantees based on Proposition 1
   of [Mir17].  After composition, one can convert the (ALPHA, TAU)-
   Rényi DP guarantee to (EPSILON, DELTA)-approximate DP, per
   Proposition 12 of [CKS20].

B.4.2.  Zero Concentrated-DP

   A formal definition of zero Concentrated-DP can be found in
   Definition 1.1 of [BS16].

   Zero Concentrated-DP uses different parameters from Rényi-DP, but
   uses a similar idea to measure the output distribution divergence of
   querying two adjacent databases.

   One can compose multiple zCDP guarantees, per Lemma 1.7 of [BS16].

B.5.  Data type and Noise type

   Differential Privacy guarantee can only be achieved if data type is
   applied with the correct noise type.

      TODO: Junye to fill, mention DAP is expected to ensure the right
      pair of VDAF and DP mechanism

      TODO: Chris P: we will mention Prio3SumVec because that's what we
      use to describe aggregator DP with amplification
